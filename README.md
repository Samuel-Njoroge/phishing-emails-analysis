# Phishing Emails Analysis.
Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a legitimate and reputable source, usually through email and text messaging. The attacker's goal is to steal money, gain access to sensitive data and login information, or to install malware on the victim's device. Phishing is a dangerous, damaging, and an increasingly common type of cyberattack.
